// The compiled-trace helper from upstream mlx-swift-lm (CompiledTrace.swift
// at e3d4a20e9), without the `compile` shadowing overloads: the vendored
// tree still calls MLX's own `compile`.

/// A compiled trace of a body that reads module weights.
///
/// The declared modules' weights become compile `inputs:`, so every call reads
/// their current values instead of the ones the first call happened to see.
/// Without that, a compiled forward silently ignores a loaded adapter or a
/// training step.
///
/// The body takes its owner as a parameter and is `@Sendable`, so it cannot
/// reach the weights any other way: capturing `self` does not compile.
///
/// ```swift
/// final class MoEBlock: Module, UnaryLayer {
///     // The body stays inside this module, so the default state covers it.
///     private let compiledForward = CompiledTrace<MoEBlock> { block, arguments in
///         [block.forward(arguments[0])]
///     }
///
///     func callAsFunction(_ x: MLXArray) -> MLXArray {
///         compiledForward(self, x)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Compilation is lazy, so a module can create its traces in `init` and they
/// still read weights loaded later. Traces never retain their owner.
///
/// A trace is built from the modules present when it first ran, so replacing
/// modules invalidates it: see `Module.invalidateCompiledTraces()`.
